## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
CADRAK is a start-up on a mission to develop a software tool for defect detection from mechanical engineering drawings. Engineers as the creators of drawings face the same problem every day: defects and errors in drawings. Individual errors are difficult and extremely time-consuming to spot, and human error may easily occur. The goal is to streamline the process from design to production, reducing delays and resource consumption, starting at the worker level, and extending through production managers to the engineers who create the drawings.
